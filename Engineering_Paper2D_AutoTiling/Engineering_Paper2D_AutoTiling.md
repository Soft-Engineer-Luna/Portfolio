# intergrating a auto tiling system in too the Paper2D Plugin

I decided to fill the gap in the paper2d Plugin, it lacked the ability to quickly and easily 
create maps, so I took it upon myself to do the required research and integrate an autotiling 
system through bit masking patterns. After research I choose to implement the pattern used by the most popular 2D rpg 
engine RPGMaker.

<br/><br/> 
I Choose to support different tile types and 8 directional auto tiling to get a much more accurate and nicer looking result from the auto tiling system.

Example image above show the concept of assigning IDs through bitmasks works on 4 direction.

<br/><br/>
The system would follow a ruleset to generate the Tile Group Sets and each sets IDs
so that no manual data would have to be entered, you can see above the red markings showing a tile
set group and inside marked with blue are the tile IDs being cut up.

The patterns that drive these systems can also be driven by a data table to override the default ruleset
that says what type of tile cases should use what combination of 4 sub tiles to create the desired tile.

Auto tiling patterns and types of behaviour are able to be defined for teach tile set.

## Challenges
With out a proper knowledge of bitmasking and binary this made the start pretty rough, but after research and practice i picked the knowledge up pretty fast. The general system for bitmasking is straight forward to implement the challenges came from building upon the Paper2D editors runtime and editor modules, keeping it fast and simple while allowing the system to still be configured for different types of patterns(and to not break stuff too!).

### few code snippets
```cpp
// Bitmask for defining the Tile type to assemble
uint8 index = (NorthWest)|(North << 1)|(NorthEast << 2)|(West << 3)|(East << 4)|(SouthWest << 5)|(South << 6)|(SouthEast << 7);
//...

// itterating through surround tiles checking adject tiles
FPaperTileInfo TargetInk = GetTile(TargetLoc.X, TargetLoc.Y, Layer);
// are we valid and not looking at the same tile?
return (GetTile(TargetLoc.X, TargetLoc.Y, Layer).IsValid() && !TargetInk.AutoTileGroupID == InkID);
//...

// painting editor snippet
    if ((Ink.IsValid() || bBlitEmptyTiles) && (TargetLayer->GetCell(TargetX, TargetY) != Ink))
        {
    		if (!bChangedSomething)
	   		{
				TargetLayer->SetFlags(RF_Transactional);
				TargetLayer->Modify();
				bChangedSomething = true;
			}

			if (FindSelectedComponent()->TileMap->AutoTileEnabled)
			{
				FindSelectedComponent()->AutoTileInkedTile(Ink, TargetX, TargetY, TargetLayer);
			}
			else
			{
				OutDirtyRect += FVector(TargetX, TargetY, LayerCoord);
				TargetLayer->SetCell(TargetX, TargetY, Ink);
			}
//...
```
